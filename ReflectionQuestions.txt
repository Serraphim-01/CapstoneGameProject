1. What Inspired your game concept. 
Answer: I wanted to create something that combined the intensity of 
classic tactical shooters with the simplicity of mobile play. Games 
like Call of Duty and Superhot inspired the core combat, but I designed 
Kill to strip down the experience to what matters most—precision, pressure,
 and progression.

2. What were your biggest challenges during development?
The biggest challenge was making sure the gameplay felt great on both 
mobile and PC. Input handling, UI scaling, and responsive controls behave 
very differently on touchscreens vs keyboard setups.

3. How did you solve major problems?
I implemented a platform detection system that automatically adjusts the 
control scheme and UI layout at runtime. For input, I built a custom 
floating joystick and tied it directly into the player controller, ensuring
parity across platforms. The UI was styled using Unity’s UI Toolkit for 
fluid responsiveness.

4. What Feature are you most proud of?
The dynamic enemy tracking and win detection system. It seamlessly manages 
enemy types, counts, and victory conditions—triggering win states, 
animations, and UI transitions without bugs or lag. It’s clean, efficient, 
and incredibly satisfying to watch in action.

5. If you had more time, wat would you improve or add?
I’d expand the Shop system, add weapon upgrades, and implement enemy 
patrol AI for more strategic gameplay. I’d also explore multiplayer 
deathmatches and a leaderboard system to encourage replayability and 
competition.
