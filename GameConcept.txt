=====================
🕹️ GAME CONCEPT - "KILL"
=====================

Kill is a fast-paced, immersive 3D action shooter built with Unity for both mobile and PC. The player takes on the role of a lone operative dropped into hostile levels filled with varying types of enemies. Each level presents a unique battlefield where survival depends on movement, aim, timing, and strategy.

The core gameplay loop revolves around selecting a level from a central Lobby, eliminating all enemies, and progressing to the next stage. The game uses a blend of stealth and aggressive tactics, supported by responsive controls—keyboard and mouse for PC, and joystick + touch input for mobile.

🔧 CORE MECHANICS
===============

1. 🎯 **Precision Aiming and Shooting**
   - Players must aim manually using mouse or screen gestures and fire with purpose. Headshots and timing matter.

2. 🧠 **Enemy Waves and Class Types**
   - Common, Elite, and Boss enemies spawn with different behaviors and health stats.

3. 🚶 **Camera-Relative Movement**
   - Movement aligns with the player’s camera direction, allowing intuitive traversal across 3D space.

4. 🕹️ **Cross-Platform Controls**
   - PC: Keyboard + Mouse
   - Mobile: Floating Joystick + Touchscreen support
   - Crouching, aiming, and shooting all work seamlessly on both platforms.

5. 🎵 **Immersive Audio Layer**
   - Dynamic background music, responsive button clicks, and satisfying gunfire elevate the experience.

6. 🖥️ **UI Toolkit-Driven UX**
   - Beautiful, pixel-inspired panels and responsive layouts using Unity’s UI Toolkit (UXML & USS).

7. 🧱 **Scalable Level Progression**
   - From the calm of the Lobby to the chaos of Level 3, the game tracks player victory and unlocks the next challenge dynamically.

==========================
🎮 WHY "KILL" STANDS OUT
==========================

It’s not just about shooting—it’s about how **well** you move, how **smart** you engage, and how **quickly** you react. “Kill” respects the player’s skill, supports both casual and serious play, and looks great on any screen.
